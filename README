This is a collection of simple libraries, used by various tools.
The libraries include:

* chkalloc - a memory protection wrapper around malloc, but not
  needed with the features now available in malloc and tools like
  valgrind and the address-sanitizers
* dstr - dynamic string management
* linked list support
* hash - hash table implementation

It was built as part of the CRiSP editor, but is a standalone set
of functions, often used by other tools, created by the author.
